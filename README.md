# My Personal Project: Vaccine Passport for CPSC 210 (Summer Term 2)

#CS ID: z3b3b

## Phase 1 - Term 2 - Task 2 - Project Information

*What will this application do?*
- It will keep records of which *vaccines* you have received (type, date)
- It will allow you to organize vaccine *record profiles* for different people in your family
- (*Optional*) Provide reminders when to receive booster shots


**Who will use it?**
- Individuals who want to *digitally* keep track of their vaccination records
- Parents who need to keep track of their child's immunization records
- Doctors could use it to keep track of their patients' immunizations

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
- As a parent, I was surprised there was no consistent digital method to keep track of family vaccinations
- Traditional methods of vaccine records, such as papers, are easily lost and inconsistent across healthcare regions
- The *COVID-19 pandemic* has brought to the global forefront of the importance of accurate vaccine records
